A couple weeks ago I completed [Getting Started with Rails][1], a guide created by the makers of Rails. It's a walkthrough showing you how to create a simple blog from scratch with Rails that nicely introduces you to the main mechanics of the program. 

![2][]

The guide is very comprehensive, and essentially holds your hand through the entire process of getting a Rails project up and running. The only problem I had with this guide was that if I ever got stuck and needed help there was no resource to turn to (I messed my indentation and it took a few frustrating hours to figure out). Help was espeically needed towards the end of the guide when things got a little more complicated.

Maybe this sounds a little ridiculous considering all you need to do is copy paste given code, but if you are in need of a reference key like I was, check [this repo][3] I made! Everything is exactly how the guide instructed. Enjoy.
